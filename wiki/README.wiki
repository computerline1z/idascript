= About =

IDAScript is a wrapper around IDA Pro that makes it easy to automate the execution of IDA scripts against target files from the command line.

This version of idascript is based on the original idascript from Hex-Rays, but is written in Python for platform independance (disclaimer: currently only tested on Linux!).

For more information on idascript, see the original idascript utility here: http://www.hexblog.com/?p=128

= Installation =

To install, run the included install.py script (typically requires root/admin privileges):

{{{
$ python ./install.py /path/to/ida/install/directory
}}}

On Linux/OSX platforms, idascript will be installed the first directory listed in $PATH.

On Windows, idascript will be placed in the specified IDA install directory.

= Usage =

IDAScript usage is very straight forward:

{{{
$ idascript ./target.bin ./myscript.py
}}}

= Scripts =

All IDAPython scripts intended for use with IDAScript must import the idascript Python module. If you want IDA to exit when the script is finished, the script must also call sys.exit when done. Example:

{{{
import idascript

print "I am an IDA script. My first command line argument is:", sys.argv[1]

sys.exit(0)
}}}

It is fairly easy to write your scripts such that they can be run from either the command line via idascript or from the interactive IDA GUI simply by including or excluding out the 'import idascript' line:

{{{
# Comment out this import to run this script from the GUI
import idascript

try:
        idascript
        print "I am being run from the command line. I will now exit."
        sys.exit(0)
except:
        print "I am not being run from the command line and will not call sys.exit. Goodbye."
}}}
