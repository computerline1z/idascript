ABOUT

	IDAScript is a wrapper around IDA Pro that makes it easy to automate the execution of IDA scripts 
	against target files from the command line.
	
	This version of idascript is based on the original idascript from Hex-Rays, but is written in Python
	for platform independance (disclaimer: currently only tested on Linux!).

	For more information on idascript, see the original idascript utility here: http://www.hexblog.com/?p=128

INSTALL

	To install, run the included install.py script. You will be prompted for the path to your IDA install directory,
	You will typically need to run the install.py script as root/admin.

	On Linux/OSX platforms, idascript will be installed the first directory listed in $PATH.

	On Windows, idascript will be placed in the specified IDA install directory.

USAGE

	IDAScript usage is very straight forward:

		$ idascript ./target.bin ./myscript.py arg1 arg2 arg3
		$ idascript --64 ./target64.bin ./myscript.py arg1 arg2 arg3

IDASCRIPT SCRIPTS

	All IDAPython scripts intended for use with idascript must import the idascript Python module. If you want
	IDA to exit when the script is finished, the script must also call sys.exit when done. Example:

		import idascript

		print "I am an IDA script. My first command line argument is:", sys.argv[1]

		sys.exit(0)

	It is fairly easy to write your scripts such that they can be run from either the command line via idascript or
	from the interactive IDA GUI simply by including or commenting out the 'import idascript' line:

		# Comment out this import to run this script from the GUI
		import idascript

		try:
			idascript
			print "I am being run from the command line. I will now exit."
			sys.exit(0)
		except:
			print "I am not being run from the command line. Goodbye."
